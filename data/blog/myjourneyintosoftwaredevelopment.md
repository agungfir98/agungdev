This will be my very first serious writing ever, It’ll be terrible I believe, but at least I tried my best pouring my thoughts into it, and will be updated over time.

I’ve been introduced to computers as early as 3 years old, I remember I used to play MotoGP I don’t know which version was it, it was old, also The Lion King game and the certified hood classic Virtua Cop 2 by SEGA, everyone knows that.

I started my development journey (seriously) recently, but I have been exposed way back to when Friendster was a thing. I remember adding music or customizing my profile page. It feels amazing, It’s like I'm a computer wizard.

I was known good at computers since elementary age, I also participate in typing and computer contests against elementary students around the city, I didn’t win but the contest was nothing to me. I’m always the go-to person when someone need help with computers or technology in general.

When I graduated junior high school, I already have a figure in my head about where will I go to high school, my choice was Vocational Highschool One Purbalingga (SMK N 1 Purbalingga) I choose Computer and Networking for my study because I wasn’t aware of what Software Engineering was an what they do because in Indonesia it’s spelled Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak and I didn’t what the hell was Rekayasa means. But fortunately, it’s still taught me how to code even though it’s more focused on computers and Networking (duh).

After I graduate unlike the majority of vocational high school graduates, I decide to go to college to get a computer or anything equivalent degree because I don’t think I want to be a working class already, I think I still have a long journey to learn many things before actually being a professional.

Long story short, I failed to land myself in the Software Engineering field and got accepted into Electrical Engineering instead. I know, Electrical Engineering is a high-demand major too but it’s not what I intended, so I wasn’t doing great during my college time. I got terrible grades, had heavy math courses, and have to write thick lab practicum reports.

In my final semester, I had to contemplate where I wanna go in my life. I know for the fact that learning is way easier when you’re interested in the subject, it’s proven many times that I always excel at the subject I’m in love with. e.g. anything related to the computer, lab practicum, and English class. So, I think I should pick software development as my career path because I love it, I enjoy it, and I can spend the whole day doing it without complaining.

As for now, I’m still a fresh graduate looking for a software engineering job or client that needs my skill while keep learning many things.

Ciao~
